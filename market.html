      <h3>Stock Highlights</h3>
      <p>Current News On The Stock Market.</p>
      <div class="more-info">
        <p>This week, the stock market experienced significant volatility, driven by shifting U.S. tariff policies and investor sentiment. President Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs for most countries sparked a substantial rally, with the S&P 500 surging 5.6%—one of its largest single-day gains since World War II—while the Nasdaq rose over 8% . However, the optimism was short-lived, as markets plunged over 6% the following day, reflecting ongoing investor anxiety . Despite these fluctuations, the Nasdaq ended the week up 7.3%, exiting bear market territory, though it remains down 13.4% for the year .​</p>

      <h3>What do stocks represent?</h3>
      <p>What are stocks?</p>
      <div class="more-info">
        <p>Stocks represent ownership in a company, meaning when you buy a stock, you're purchasing a small piece—or share—of that company. As a shareholder, you become a part-owner, which can give you certain rights, such as voting on key company decisions. Stocks also offer the potential to earn money in two main ways: through dividends, which are a portion of the company’s profits shared with shareholders, and by selling the stock later at a higher price if its value increases. However, stock ownership also comes with risks, as the value can go down depending on the company’s performance and market conditions.</p>

      <h3>Why Invest?</h3>
      <p>What do you gain from investing?.</p>
      <div class="more-info">
        <p>Investing is important because it helps you grow your money over time and build wealth for the future. Instead of letting your money sit in a savings account with low interest, investing gives it the chance to earn higher returns through stocks, bonds, real estate, or other assets. It can help you reach big financial goals like buying a home, starting a business, or retiring comfortably. Investing also allows you to take advantage of compound growth, where your earnings start earning more money on their own. While there are risks involved, smart and informed investing can be one of the best ways to secure your financial future.</p>

      <h3>The Stock's Role Today</h3>
      <p>How does investing affect our economy?.</p>
      <div class="more-info">
        <p>In today’s economy, stocks are playing a major role in driving growth and reflecting key trends like the rise of artificial intelligence and shifts in global trade. For example, companies like Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor have seen their stock prices soar due to high demand for AI technology, signaling how investor money is fueling innovation in that sector. Meanwhile, fluctuations in the broader stock market—such as the recent rally sparked by a temporary pause on U.S. tariffs—show how markets react quickly to policy changes, impacting investor confidence and economic outlook. At the same time, traditional companies like Berkshire Hathaway reaching a $1 trillion market value demonstrate how investors still value stable, long-term growth. These events highlight how the stock market not only helps businesses fund expansion but also mirrors the hopes and concerns of the economy as a whole.</p>
